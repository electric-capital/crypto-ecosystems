# 🌲 Crypto Ecosystems
Crypto Ecosystems is a taxonomy of open source blockchain, web3, cryptocurrency, and decentralized ecosystems and their code repositories.

This dataset is not complete, and hopefully it never will be as there are new ecosystems and repositories created every day.

## How to use this taxonomy
The taxonomy can be used to generate the set of crypto ecosystems, their corresponding sub ecosystems, and repositories at a particular time.

You can export the taxonomy to a json format by using the following command:
```bash
./run.sh export exports.jsonl
```

If you want to export a single ecosystem, its sub ecosystems, and its repositories, you can use the `-e` parameter to specify a particular ecosystem.
```bash
./run.sh export -e Bitcoin bitcoin.jsonl
```

The export format is one json entry per line like the following:
```json
{"eco_name":"Bitcoin","branch":["Lightning"],"repo_url":"https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis","tags":["#developer-tool"]}
{"eco_name":"Bitcoin","branch":["Lightning"],"repo_url":"https://github.com/bottlepay/lnd","tags":[]}
```
By using the branch attribute, you can see how particular repos are attributed to the parent ecosystem.

## How to update the taxonomy
There is a domain specific language (DSL) containing the keywords that can make changes to the taxonomy.  You specify migrations by using files of the format
```bash
migrations/YYYY-MM-DDThhmmss_description_of_your_migration
```

The datetime format is a loosely ISO8601 but without the ':' characters to make them valid files on Windows.

Some examples migration filenames could be:
```bash
migrations/2009-01-03T181500_add_bitcoin
migrations/2015-07-30T152613_add_ethereum
```

Simply create your new migration and add changes to the taxonomy using the keywords discussed below.

## Data Format

### Example: Adding an ecosystem and connecting it.
```lua
-- Add ecosystems with the ecoadd keyword.  You can start a line with -- to denote a comment.
ecoadd Lightning
-- Add repos to ecosystems using the repadd keyword
repadd Lightning https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd #protocol
-- Connect ecosystems using the ecocon keyword.
-- The following connects Lighting as a sub ecosystem of Bitcoin.
ecocon Bitcoin Lighting
```
