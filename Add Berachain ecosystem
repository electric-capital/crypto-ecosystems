## Description  
This PR adds [Berachain](https://berachain.com) to the crypto ecosystems dataset as a new L1 ecosystem.  

## Changes  
- Added `data/ecosystems/b/berachain.json` with core metadata:  
  - Official GitHub repos (including Beratrail testnet)  
  - Twitter handle  
  - Website  

## Validation  
- JSON validated via [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com)  
- Confirmed no duplicates in existing datasets  
- All links are live (HTTP 200)  

## Context

## Future Work  
- Could later add sub-ecosystems (e.g., Berachain-native DApps) as they emerge
