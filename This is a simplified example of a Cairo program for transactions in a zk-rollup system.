1. Input and Output Definition
cairo
Copy code
# Define the main program.
def main(inputs, outputs):
    # Read input values.
    old_balance = inputs[0]
    transfer_amount = inputs[1]
    recipient_account = inputs[2]

    # Ensure the transfer amount is non-negative.
    assert transfer_amount >= 0

    # Compute the new balance for the sender.
    new_balance_sender = old_balance - transfer_amount

    # Compute the new balance for the recipient.
    new_balance_recipient = outputs[0]

    # Ensure the recipient's balance is updated correctly.
    assert new_balance_recipient == old_balance + transfer_amount

    # Update the balances in the outputs.
    outputs[1] = new_balance_sender
    outputs[2] = new_balance_recipient
Input Parameters: The main function takes three inputs: old_balance, transfer_amount, and recipient_account. It also takes three outputs: new_balance_recipient, new_balance_sender, and an unused_output.

Input Validation: It asserts that the transfer_amount is non-negative.

Balance Computation: It computes the new balance for the sender (new_balance_sender) by subtracting the transfer amount from the old balance. It also retrieves the new_balance_recipient from the outputs.

Balance Update Check: It asserts that the new_balance_recipient is equal to the sum of the old balance and the transfer amount.

Output Update: It updates the balances in the outputs.

2. Entry Point Definition
cairo
Copy code
# Define the entry point for the program.
entry:
    # Three inputs (old_balance, transfer_amount, recipient_account)
    # Three outputs (new_balance_recipient, new_balance_sender, unused_output)
    3 -> main
Entry Point: The entry section specifies that the entry point is the main function. It indicates that there are three inputs and three outputs for this program.
3. Constraints Definition
cairo
Copy code
# Define the constraints for the main program.
def main_constraints(inputs, outputs, constraints):
    # Read input values.
    old_balance = inputs[0]
    transfer_amount = inputs[1]
    recipient_account = inputs[2]

    # Read output values.
    new_balance_recipient = outputs[0]
    new_balance_sender = outputs[1]

    # Enforce the correctness of the transaction.
    enforce new_balance_recipient == old_balance + transfer_amount
    enforce new_balance_sender == old_balance - transfer_amount
Constraint Function: The main_constraints function specifies additional constraints on the inputs and outputs.

Input and Output Retrieval: It retrieves the input and output values.

Transaction Correctness Constraints: It enforces that the new_balance_recipient is equal to the sum of the old balance and the transfer amount, and new_balance_sender is equal to the old balance minus the transfer amount.

4. Constraints Entry
cairo
Copy code
# Specify the constraints for the main program.
entry:
    3 -> main
    2 -> main_constraints
Constraints Entry Point: It indicates that the entry points for the constraints are the main function and the main_constraints function.
